# Platforms

A platform is the place where Adiungo actually runs. From here, Adiungo will fetch, or index the data from the services
you specify. How a platform integrates Adiungo varies, for example - WordPress does it using a plugin. Other platforms,
such as Laravel, would integrate Adiungo differently, although both platforms would ultimately lean on the
same [integrations](/integrations) to accomplish their goals.
